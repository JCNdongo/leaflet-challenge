# Leaflet Challenge: Earthquake Visualization

In this challenge, I created a visualization of every Magnitude 4.5 and above earthquake for the past 30 days (as of 6/10/2023).

I retrieved the following json dataset from the USGS: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_month.geojson

Using the Leaflet js library, I created a map based on the dataset. My map contains data markers with details about each earthquake. 

The visualization is available on the following link: https://jcndongo.github.io/earthquake.github.io/
